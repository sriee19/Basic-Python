# # Getting Input

# instead of print we use input to get inputs from the users

# In[1]:


name = input('What is your name? ')
print('Hi! ' + name)


# here we collected the name of the person and printed with hi!

# # Question

# Ask two Questions: person's name and favorite color.
# then, print a message like "San like red"

# In[3]:


getname = input('whats your name?  ')
getcolor = input('whats your fav color? ')
print(getname + ' LIKES ' + getcolor)
